Retail Data Analytics – Business Insights Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes online retail transaction data to uncover key business insights related to revenue growth, customer behavior, and market opportunities.

The objective was to move beyond basic visualization and focus on executive-level decision support, answering questions typically raised by CEOs and CMOs.

This project demonstrates end-to-end analytics, from data cleaning to insight-driven storytelling.

🎯 Business Questions

The analysis was guided by the following business questions:

Which regions, customer segments, and product categories contribute most to total revenue?

Is revenue growth sustainable, or concentrated in a small set of products and markets?

How valuable are customers over time, and what proportion of revenue comes from repeat buyers?

Which markets and customer segments represent the strongest opportunities for future growth?

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

Tableau – Data visualization and dashboard creation

Excel / CSV – Data exploration and preparation

Business Analytics Techniques, including:

Revenue analysis

Customer repeat purchase analysis

RFM segmentation

Pareto (80/20) analysis

🔍 Key Insights

Revenue is highly concentrated across a small number of regions and products, indicating potential dependency risk.

The majority of customers make only a single purchase, limiting overall customer lifetime value.

A small segment of loyal customers contributes disproportionately to total revenue.

Certain international markets show strong revenue per customer but low purchase frequency, presenting targeted growth opportunities.
